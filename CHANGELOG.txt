- Added logging to a file.  

You will need to assign the following configuration variables in 
settings_local.py:

    * LOG_FILENAME: The log file name to be created.  The log will 
      be rotated automatically.
    * LOG_INTERVAL: How often the logs should be rotated.
    * LOG_BACKUP_COUNT: How many logs should be saved.
    * LOG_LEVEL: The log level to be recorded in  the log file.

Usable default values can be found in conf/settings_local-default.py
and suitable values for the production instances have been set in the
settings_local.py file for each instance.

A logger instance that will log to the file can be instantiated like this:

    import core.utils
    logger = core.utils.get_logger(__name__)

A logger created in this way will log all levels, even those below LOG_LEVEL
to the console.
